## My creative journey through storytelling

Welcome to my novel-writing corner.
Here you’ll find everything connected to my long-form projects — especially the supernatural, music-infused world of Kell & Co.

My writing blends:
	- Ghost lore and atmospheric horror
	- Deep emotional character arcs
	- Music as magic
	- Found-family dynamics
	- Mystery, memory, sacrifice

This is where the big stories live.

### Featured project: Kell & Co

*Sometimes a melody is a warning. Sometimes it’s a door*

#### Quick Summary

Kell Blake hears more in music than anyone else — harmonies shaped like shadows, melodies that flicker with ghosts. After a rooftop concert goes wrong, Kell discovers he has the ability to open the Veil between worlds using sound.

But power always comes with a price.
And the Veil always wants something back.

As Kell’s life spirals — bruises he hides, memories slipping, ghosts following unfinished chords — his bandmates are pulled in:
Decker, steady and unshakeable;
Theo, accidentally Named by Kell;
Ethan, furious and protective in equal measure.

When a deadly haunting tied to the ancient Ridgeway military road resurfaces, Kell must choose what (and who) he’s willing to sacrifice to stop it — even if the Veil wants a part of him each time.
