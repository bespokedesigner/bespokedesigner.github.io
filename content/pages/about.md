I’m a graphic design manager from Oxfordshire in the UK with vast experience spanning email, web and print design projects. I have been the designer for emails sent to thousands of customers of my current employer over the last 10 years. For the past 6 years I’ve coordinated the whole process for many campaigns; from gathering and negotiating requirements from key stakeholders to delivering the scheduled email to customers.

In my downtime, I love to play piano, read and write fiction, follow explorers on YouTube and keep fit through exercise and walking.
