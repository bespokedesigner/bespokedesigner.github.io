Ghosts & Music 
I write stories where ghosts follow melodies, where abandoned roads remember their dead, and where a college band accidentally becomes the centre of a haunting.
My main project is Kell & Co, a supernatural fiction series inspired by music, memory, trauma, and found family. I’m also a musician, and every piece I practice shapes how I write — from the smallest phrasing to the way I imagine the Veil.
Ghosts & Music is my creative home.
It’s where fiction and practice meet in the middle.
