  title: "Ghosts & Music"
  content: |-
    I write stories where ghosts follow melodies, where abandoned roads remember their dead, and where a college band accidentally becomes the centre of a haunting.
    My main project is Kell & Co, a supernatural fiction series inspired by music, memory, trauma, and found family. I’m also a musician, and every piece I practice shapes how I write — from the smallest phrasing to the way I imagine the Veil.
    Ghosts & Music is my creative home.
    It’s where fiction and practice meet in the middle.

    content: "Music shapes everything I create.
    My piano journey runs alongside my writing, influencing the atmosphere, rhythm, and emotional tone of the Kell & Co world. I’m currently studying pieces like Sonatina in C and L’absque, building technique, confidence, and musical storytelling through daily practice.
    
    Here you’ll find updates on what I’m learning, how it inspires scenes in my stories, and how classical music weaves itself into the supernatural themes of Ghosts & Music."
